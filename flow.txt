AWS Setup: 
      * Login to AWS console.
      * Keep region set as - us-east-1
      * Go to IAM >> Create new user (name: vehicle-insurance-owner)
      * Attach policy >> select AdministratorAccess >> next >> create user
      * Go to the user >> Security Credentials >> Access Keys >> Create access key
      * Select CLI >> agree to condition >> next >> Create Access Key >> download csv file
      * Set env variables with above csv values using below method:
                - export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
                - export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"


Project Part: 
    * Now add the access key, secret key, region name to constants.__init__.py
    * Add code to src.configuration.aws_connection.py file (To work with AWS S3 service)
    * Ensure below info in constants.__init__.py file:
        MODEL_EVALUATION_CHANGED_THRESHOLD_SCORE: float = 0.02
        MODEL_BUCKET_NAME = "nawrinbucket"
        MODEL_PUSHER_S3_KEY = "model-registry"

    * Go to S3 service >> Create bucket >> Region: us-east-1 >> General purpose >>
        Bucket Name: "my-model-mlopsproj" >> uncheck: "Block all public access" and acknowledge >>
        Hit Create Bucket



############### CI/CD on AWS ################

Getting started with CI-CD process:
      * Setup the dockerfile and .dockerignore file
      * Setup the .github\workflows dir and aws.yaml file within

        Continuous Integration 
            - code checkout
            - aws Credentials Setup
            - aws Login to ECR 
            - Build Docker image and push to dockerhub 

        Continuous Deployment
            - 
    
      * Go to AWS console and create a new IAM user exactly the way we did earlier (name: "usvisa-user") >>
        Go inside user >> Security Credentials >> Access Keys >> create access key >> CLI >> check agreement
        >> next >> create access key >> download csv
      * Now create one ECR repo to store/save docker image:
        AWS console >> Go to ECR >> Region: us-east-1 >> Hit create repository >>
        repo name: vehicle_insurance >> hit create repository >> copy and keep uri
      * Now create EC2 Ubuntu server >> AWS console >> EC2 >> Launch Instance >> name: vehicledata-machine
        >> Image: Ubuntu >> AMI: Ubuntu Server 24.04 (free tier) >> Instance: T2 Medium (~chargeable-3.5rs/hr)
        >> create new key pair (name: proj1key) >> allow for https and http traffic >> storage: 30gb >> Launch
        >> Go to instance >> click on "Connect" >> Connect using EC2 Instance Connect 
        >> Connect (Terminal will be launched)
